/* Scripts/Mobiles/Vendors/SBInfo/SBTrader.cs
 * ChangeLog
 *  11/8/22, Adam: (Vendor System)
 *  Complete overhaul of the vendor system:
 * - DisplayCache:
 *   Display cache objects are now strongly typed and there is a separate list for each.
 *   I still dislike the fact it is a �Container�, but we can live with that.
 *   Display cache objects are serialized and are deleted on each server restart as the vendors rebuild the list.
 *   Display cache objects are marked as �int map storage� so Cron doesn�t delete them.
 * - ResourcePool:
 *   Properly exclude all ResourcePool interactions when resource pool is not being used. (Buy/Sell now works correctly without ResourcePool.)
 *   Normalize/automate all ResourcePool resources for purchase/sale within a vendor. If a vendor Sells X, he will Buy X. 
 *   At the top of each SB<merchant> there is a list of ResourcePool types. This list is uniformly looped over for creating all ResourcePool buy/sell entries.
 * - Standard Pricing Database
 *   No longer do we hardcode in what we believe the buy/sell price of X is. We now use a Standard Pricing Database for assigning these prices.
 *   I.e., BaseVendor.PlayerPays(typeof(Drums)), or BaseVendor.VendorPays(typeof(Drums))
 *   This database was derived from RunUO 2.6 first and added items not covered from Angel Island 5.
 *   The database was then filtered, checked, sorted and committed. 
 * - Make use of Rule Sets as opposed to hardcoding shard configurations everywhere.
 *   Exampes:
 *   if (Core.UOAI_SVR) => if (Core.RuleSets.AngelIslandRules())
 *   if (Server.Engines.ResourcePool.ResourcePool.Enabled) => if (Core.RuleSets.ResourcePoolRules())
 *   etc. In this way we centrally adjust who sell/buys what when. And using the SPD above, for what price.
 *	27/06/09, plasma
 *		Increased bulk regs +1gp to offset factions
 *  10/18/04, Froste
 *      Added a MinValue param equal to the amount param
 *	10/18/04, Adam
 *		Reduce bulk prices a tad, and increase quantities
 *  10/17/04, Froste
 *      Modified version of SBImporter.cs
 *  6/5/04, Pix
 *		Merged in 1.0RC0 code.
 *	5/22/04, mith
 *		Modified so that Mages only sell up to level 3 scrolls.
 *	4/24/04, mith
 *		Commented all items from SellList so that NPCs don't buy from players.
