/* Scripts/Engines/AI/AI/SuicideAI.cs
 * CHANGELOG
 *	1/1/09, Adam
 *		Add new Serialization model for creature AI.
 *		BaseCreature will already be serializing this data when I finish the upgrade, so all you need to do is add your data to serialize. 
 *		Make sure to use the SaveFlags to optimize saves by not writing stuff that is non default.
 *	1/5/05, Pix
 *		Now doesn't do anything but wander.
 *  1/3/05, Pix
 *		Initial version.
