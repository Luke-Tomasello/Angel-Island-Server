/* Scripts\Engines\AIMusicSystem\MusicBox\MusicBox.Placement.cs
 * Changelog
 *  11/5/26, Adam (2026 modernization, 10/30/26 to 11/5/26)
 *      Where a music box is (in the world, carried by a hired minstrel, elsewhere) decides whom it serves and how it
 *      answers; every rule that depends on it is here (speech, rights, access, replies, range, the listener check). A
 *      box in a container says "This must be in a house and be locked down to work." (it said "fail").
 *      Split from MusicBox.Speech.cs, MusicBox.Playback.cs, MusicBox.CommandHelpers.cs and MusicBox.cs; their history
 *      before 10/30/26 is in MusicBox.cs.
 *      Portable AIMS: logging, the stable hash, Shuffle, LocalTimer and the Data folder go through AimsLog and AimsUtil
 *      (Host\), so this folder drops into other RunUO servers.
 *      AimsUtil: GetDistanceToSqrt. Angel Island only (#if ANGEL_ISLAND): the hired minstrel's box.
