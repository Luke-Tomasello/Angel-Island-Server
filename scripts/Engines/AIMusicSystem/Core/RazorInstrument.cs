/* Scripts/Skill Items/Musical Instruments/RazorInstrument.cs
 * ChangeLog
 *  11/6/26, Adam (2026 modernization, 10/23/26 to 11/6/26)
 *      A song's performance is an object (Performance, returned by StartMusic and StartDeviceMusic) with a State,
 *      Cancel() and Completed, raised exactly once with why it ended; a timer callback of an earlier performance stops
 *      quietly, and a performance whose session is replaced or released ends instead of playing into the new one.
 *      Music devices play on their own sessions. One performance per performer (PerformanceOf): a second sheet can no
 *      longer start in a song's pause and interleave with it. '# Timer: Classic|Dynamic|Anchored' selects a song's
 *      timer; in an Anchored song the waits keep exact time too. A song's '# Instrument:' takes effect on its first
 *      play. Duplicates no longer keep their source's playback links, and a songless sheet plays nothing (not 'Ride of
 *      the Valkyries'). Five unused settings are gone (MusicChatter, CheckMusicianship, IgnoreDirectives, MinMusicSkill,
 *      PreferredInstrument): Serialize version 8. Place_obsolete and Year_obsolete are gone too (the first award
 *      instruments' place and year; AwardInstrument keeps its own): Serialize version 9, and an older save's values are
 *      kept, unsaved, for [Nuke ReplaceAwardInstruments (LegacyAwardPlace, LegacyAwardYear). A world saved as version 8
 *      or 9 needs this build or later to load.
 *      Portable AIMS: logging, the stable hash, Shuffle, LocalTimer and the Data folder go through AimsLog and AimsUtil
 *      (Host\), so this folder drops into other RunUO servers.
 *      AimsHost: staff messages. Angel Island only (#if ANGEL_ISLAND): the unstealable, unlootable loot type (else
 *      blessed) and MusicMotionController.
 *  12/28/23, Adam (PlayerProgressCallback() => MusicConfig[player].Tick)
 *      Pass  a callback to the system player to notify us if the system is still processing notes. 
 *      Since this is called on every tick of the system player, it is our responsibility to limit processing so as to not impact playback.
 *      Typically, we (the caller) will only process the tick every two seconds or so to verify the player-mobile is still around to hear the music.
 *      Hierarchy: system player generates a timer tick to process some notes.
 *          the system player calls the MusicConfig[player].Tick()
 *          We (the RazorInstrument,) will only process this tick every two seconds. We will callback to the Calypso Music Player to handle it.
 *          The Calypso Music Player implements a CheckUser() function that verifies the mobile that played the music is still around to hear it.
 *          If Elvis has left the building, playback is canceled and everything cleaned up. 
 *  6/3/2023, Adam (Newbie'ness)
 *      Make RazorInstrument (LootType.UnStealable | LootType.UnLootable) so that is newbied for reds too 
 *  2/26/22, Adam
 *      Add support for ConcertMode
 *  2/19/22, Adam
 *      Major rework of the music system. Obsolete 'award instrument' specific variables from RazorInstrument and move them to AwardInstrument (new)
 *  2/10/22, Adam (StartMusic)
 *      Add a check to set a null instrument to 'this'
 *          i.e., m_instrument = instrument != null ? instrument : this;
 *  1/31/22, Adam
 *      Add a new callback to check the mobiles status (like have they logged out or moved away).
 *  1/27/22, Adam
 *      Have pause kill the song after 250 seconds.
 *  1/25/22, Adam
 *      Add support for a preferred instrument that overrides the RazorInstrument default (of harp)
 *  1/12/22, Adam
 *      Change Place 0 from "Loser" to "Honorable Mention"
 *  1/8/22, Adam (BabyRazor)
 *      Restart BabyRazor when a line (like blank lines) is unrecognized.
 *  1/2/21, adam (Play.Player)
 *      Use the new, more flexable Player interface that accepts finer grained configuration of the music player
 *          New properties include minMusicSkill, instrument, requiresBackpack, musicChatter, and checkMusicianship
 *  12/13/21, Adam
 *      First time checkin
