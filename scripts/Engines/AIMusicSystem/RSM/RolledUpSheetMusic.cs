/* Scripts/Engines/AIMusicSystem/RSM/RolledUpSheetMusic.cs
 * Changelog
 *  11/5/26, Adam (2026 modernization, 10/25/26 to 11/5/26)
 *      Laid out for reading. [Dupe copies the whole sheet (it made a blank one) and the copy plays itself; a sheet
 *      without a composition plays nothing (HasComposition). GenHashCode no longer leaves a stray ManuscriptPaper in
 *      the world; CompareTo compares hashes (it could overflow). Serialize writes version 4 plainly (the same bytes).
 *      Portable AIMS: logging, the stable hash, Shuffle, LocalTimer and the Data folder go through AimsLog and AimsUtil
 *      (Host\), so this folder drops into other RunUO servers.
 *      AimsHost: account GUIDs and copies (CopySheet makes the copy). Angel Island only (#if ANGEL_ISLAND): Dupe and
 *      CanDelete; elsewhere the sheet keeps its own OwnerGUID (saved after the composition).
 *  4/24/2024, Adam (TrackID)
 *      Add a trackID for identifying a RSM by title, and author/owner (differs from HashCode which is a hash of the music.)
 *  2/26/22, Adam (ConcertMode)
 *      Add support for ConcertMode
 *  2/18/22, Adam (Napster)
 *      Add the notion of a 'Napster' model for music sharing
 *  2/4/22, Adam
 *      Set the Instrument to 'this' during construction and when playing a file
 *  1/26/22, Adam
 *      Update the hash system to use a persistent and deterministic hash.
 *  1/25/22, Adam
 *      Add the mobile/price to the persistent elements of the RolledUpSheetMusic. This is used to pay the owner when his music is purchased.
 *  1/20/22, Adam
 *      Add IComparable/IEquatable
 *      Set configuration parameters on creation instead of on use.
 *  1/16/22, Adam (Dupe)
 *      Added public properties for Author, Title, and Composition so that completed compositions can be duped.
 *  1/12/22, Adam
 *		Initial creation.
